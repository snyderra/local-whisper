# Changelog

This changelog tracks notable Local Whisper changes.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Made the menu bar update action use the same Homebrew/source-aware path as `wh update`, including model preparation, Swift UI rebuilds when needed, service restart, and a service-ready check before reporting success.
- Kept the recording overlay visible during live recording updates by repairing the panel when repeated `state_update` snapshots arrive, not only when the phase changes.
- Enforced one Local Whisper service per macOS user with a global per-user lock that is independent of `HOME`, and cleaned up legacy duplicate `wh _run` processes from older HOME-scoped lock paths.
- Added clearer top-level service control docs for `wh status`, `wh start`, `wh stop`, `wh restart`, `wh log`, `wh doctor`, and `wh update`.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added a one-command installer (`install.sh`) that installs the Homebrew formula and runs guided first-time setup from Terminal.
- Added `wh setup` as the first-time setup command for Homebrew installs, covering config creation, model preparation, macOS permissions, and service startup.
- Added a dedicated installation guide with recommended, manual Homebrew, source, update, permission, and uninstall paths.

### Changed

- Made the README and `setup.sh` setup copy calmer and more direct while keeping the local model, privacy, and permission details explicit.

## [1.6.4] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Updated the Qwen3-ASR and Kokoro MLX package requirements to the current published releases.
- Let Qwen3-ASR use model-side language detection instead of forcing English.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Reset stale macOS input streams when the first recording after sleep, wake, or a long idle period opens with a PortAudio/CoreAudio error or returns all-zero audio, so hotkey recording and `wh listen` recover the microphone before surfacing a failed transcription.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added mobile history ownership controls: export local transcript history as Markdown to the clipboard, delete individual transcripts, clear all history with confirmation, and see saved entry, audio-duration, and storage estimates in the History tab.

### Changed

- Aligned public docs, setup/onboarding copy, issue templates, and mobile guides with the project voice: local-first, concrete about runtime boundaries, and specific about the macOS, iOS, and Android surfaces.

### Fixed

- Brought the Android keyboard closer to the iOS keyboard surface: the app's Keyboard quick insert toggle now controls Android mode and punctuation shortcuts, and the Android keyboard includes Clean, Message, Notes, Prompt, punctuation, Space, New line, and Delete actions.
- Made mobile model-pack installs more resilient: Hugging Face snapshot manifests and model files now retry transient network, 408, 429, and 5xx failures before surfacing an install error, and downloaded files are still verified against the local manifest before a pack is marked ready.
- Added Flutter mobile analyze and widget-test coverage to CI, plus Dependabot coverage for the Flutter `pubspec.yaml`, so the iOS/Android surface is protected alongside Python and Swift.
- Made the service lifecycle setting real end-to-end: `[service].idle_unload_minutes` now loads from `config.toml`, appears in `wh config` and macOS Advanced settings, and macOS changes reschedule the running service without restart. The macOS app also now receives and exposes the English engine's `max_tokens`, and `wh config show` uses the current engine and speech defaults.
- Kept Apple Intelligence requirement handling consistent across setup, docs, CLI metadata, and the macOS UI: public surfaces now state macOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled, and setup/doctor only install the optional SDK extra on supported systems.
- Tightened privacy wording in the package metadata and macOS onboarding/about panels so setup/model downloads are not implied to be network-free.
- Aligned the generated default TOML and full configuration reference, including service lifecycle settings, dictation commands, and Qwen3-ASR decoding tunables.
- Updated CI to Node 24-ready GitHub Actions and added weekly Dependabot coverage for workflow actions.
- Changed project licensing from MIT to PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0, with required notices preserving the Local Whisper name and copyright attribution.
- Pinned `pydantic` and `pydantic-core` together so Kokoro, misaki, and spaCy cannot install an ABI-mismatched core wheel that prevents TTS model loading.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Fresh installs now get ffmpeg.** Parakeet-TDT (the default transcription engine since 1.5.0) shells out to `ffmpeg` for audio decoding, but `setup.sh` only installed `espeak-ng`. A clean machine would hit a cryptic "ffmpeg not installed" error on the first transcription. `setup.sh`, the Homebrew formula, and `wh doctor --fix` now install ffmpeg alongside espeak-ng.
- **Overlay pill is now visible over fullscreen apps.** The pill's window level was too low for an accessory app, so fullscreen windows sometimes occluded it; switching spaces was the only way to see the recording state. The overlay now sits at the screen-saver level while still keeping the menu bar accessible.
- **Overlay no longer drifts to the left edge on certain displays.** Positioning now picks the screen under the cursor (falling back to the main screen, then the first screen) and skips the move entirely if the chosen display reports a degenerate frame during sleep/wake or hot-plug. The one-off "pill jumped to the left side" glitch traced to `NSScreen.main` returning a secondary display on the logical left of the primary.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Inline download progress bars.** Switching to an un-downloaded engine or turning on Text-to-Speech now shows a real progress bar with megabytes, total, and percent under the triggering section, driven by a byte count polled from the HF cache directory. No modal dialogs and no overlay takeover; the bar lives inside the card that started the download.
- **Merged "Speech-to-text model" panel.** Transcription settings now show one card per engine that acts as both the picker and the status readout. Active card is accent-tinted with an "In use" marker; inactive cards offer Use, Use & download, or trash in place. The previous separate engine picker has been retired. Per-engine tuning knobs render below the active card.
- **Eager Kokoro preload.** Flipping Text-to-Speech on immediately downloads the Kokoro voice model with visible progress instead of deferring to the first ⌥T press. First speak after enabling is instant.

### Fixed

- **Engine switching now works even when a model is not yet on disk.** The LaunchAgent plist no longer hard-pins `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, and the running service clears any stale value on startup, so switching to a fresh engine mid-session downloads its weights. Previous versions failed with a generic "Switch failed" on the first attempt.
- **Text-to-Speech toggle no longer only flips the config.** Turning TTS off from the menu bar or Settings tears down the processor and unbinds ⌥T; turning it on now spins them up without a service restart. Toggle state in the UI matches reality.
- **Clearer error messages** when a download fails: offline / network failures surface as "needs internet" or "network error" instead of raw exception text.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Parakeet-TDT v3 is the new default transcription engine.** NVIDIA's Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 ships as the default because it is accurate, multilingual, and practical on Apple Silicon. It runs in-process via [parakeet-mlx](https://github.com/senstella/parakeet-mlx), supports English plus 24 European languages, and handles long audio through overlapping 120s chunks. Qwen3-ASR remains available for English-only workflows via `wh engine qwen3_asr`; WhisperKit remains available as a third option.
- **Parakeet settings panel** in Transcription shows model, chunking (`chunk_duration`, `overlap_duration`), decoding strategy (`greedy` / `beam`), beam tuning (`beam_size`, `length_penalty`, `patience`, `duration_reward`), timeout, and local-attention mode with adjustable context size.
- **`setup.sh`, `wh doctor`, and `wh update` are now engine-aware.** Only the currently-selected transcription engine's model is downloaded and warmed. Fresh installs pull Parakeet-TDT v3 (~600 MB). Switching to Qwen3-ASR later lazy-loads that model on the engine's first call; neither engine holds RAM when the other is active. Warm-up compiles the MLX graph so first inference is fast. It does not pin the model in memory.
- Dedicated warm-up sentinels at `~/.whisper/models/.parakeet_v3_warmed` and `~/.whisper/models/.qwen3_warmed` so re-running setup skips the one-time graph compile.

### Changed

- New installs default to `engine = "parakeet_v3"` in `config.toml`. Existing installs keep their current engine; switch anytime via Settings or `wh engine parakeet_v3`.
- Menu bar engine submenu now lists Parakeet-TDT v3 first, followed by Qwen3-ASR (English) and WhisperKit.
- **Text-to-Speech is opt-in.** Turn it on from the menu bar or Settings -> Voice; the first ⌥T then downloads the Kokoro-82M voice model (~170 MB) and loads the spaCy `en_core_web_sm` dictionary. `setup.sh`, `wh doctor`, and `wh update` skip the Kokoro model and spaCy dictionary while TTS is off and surface them as informational notes instead of failures. Run `./setup.sh` with TTS enabled to pre-fetch everything so the first speak is instant.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Overlay no longer freezes mid-transcription.** The waveform stacked 28 overlapping animations per RMS sample, which could back up the SwiftUI render pipeline until the pill stopped animating entirely. RMS updates are now throttled to 30 Hz and drive a single animation transaction. The phase transition (recording → processing → done) no longer tears down the view subtree, so in-flight animations and state survive the handover cleanly.
- **Service can no longer stall on a slow overlay.** The IPC sender used `sendall()` with no total-time cap; if the Swift UI was briefly busy, the pipeline thread could block indefinitely on the socket. Writes now use `MSG_DONTWAIT` with a 5-second cap and drop snapshot updates rather than queue them under contention. A stalled consumer drops the connection and reconnects instead of freezing the service.
- **Transcription heartbeat.** Long transcriptions sent exactly one "Transcribing…" state update and then nothing until completion. A 2-second heartbeat now keeps the overlay and service visibly in sync for any recording length.

### Changed

- **Overlay shadow redesign.** The drop shadow is now a crisp capsule-shaped halo that matches the pill exactly and adapts to light/dark mode. Light mode uses a subtle 8% black halo; dark mode uses a stronger 28%. The previous shadow was too heavy on white backgrounds and read as rectangular instead of rounded.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Settings auto-fetch**: opening Advanced Settings now probes Ollama and LM Studio immediately for their model lists and shows an Apple Intelligence availability row. No more manual "Fetch Models" tap before the Model picker populates. Per-URL caching prevents network storms on tab switching; changing a Check URL clears the cache and re-probes.
- **Crash-recovery pipeline**: the service writes a marker at `~/.whisper/processing.marker` before heavy work and clears it on completion. On boot the service replays any interrupted transcription in the background and surfaces a `Recovered transcription` notification. A forced restart, panic, or power loss no longer silently drops a recording.
- **Chunked long-session pipeline**: recordings longer than five minutes run through a dedicated pipeline that transcribes, grammar-corrects and persists each VAD segment to `~/.whisper/current_session.jsonl` before the next segment. If the service crashes mid-lecture, whatever chunks completed are committed as a `[Interrupted]`-tagged history entry on the next boot instead of vanishing.
- **Pipeline watchdog**: per-stage timeouts (transcribe 20 min, grammar 90 s, paste 8 s) prevent a single wedged backend from freezing the service. On a transcription timeout the engine is force-reloaded to clear any half-committed MLX/decoder state.
- **LaunchAgent self-healing**: the plist now uses `KeepAlive={SuccessfulExit=false}` with a 10-second `ThrottleInterval` and 30-second `ExitTimeOut`, plus a separate `service.err.log`. Crashes auto-restart; clean stops don't. Expected permission exits (mic permission denied) exit 0 so launchd does not hot-loop.
- **Sleep/wake resilience**: the Swift app observes `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification` and sends a `resync_audio` IPC action on wake. The service also runs a 60-second audio-monitor heartbeat so a dead CoreAudio stream from sleep/wake or a mic swap is reaped and rebuilt without manual action.
- **Quieter-voice support**: VAD now adds a 210 ms trailing-edge hangover so soft word tails aren't clipped, and normalization adds an adaptive second-stage gain (up to +16 dB total, clip-guarded) for recordings that the primary 10 dB cap can't raise to a usable level.
- **Low-confidence transcription retry**: when Qwen3-ASR returns an empty result on a short clip, the engine retries once with `temperature=0.2`, `top_p=0.95` before returning "No speech"; this avoids the common case where greedy decoding gets stuck on valid audio.
- **Expanded `wh status`**: shows uptime, RSS, and any pending recovery work (interrupted transcriptions, partial long sessions) so you can see why the service did something at boot.
- **Voice dictation commands**: speak "new line", "new paragraph", "period", "comma", "question mark", "exclamation mark", "colon", "semicolon", "dash", "scratch that", and more, and Local Whisper replaces the phrase with the literal punctuation or whitespace. Runs before grammar correction so the grammar pass sees well-punctuated sentences. Toggle in `~/.whisper/config.toml` under `[dictation]`; add custom commands under `[dictation.commands]`.
- **`wh export`** writes the full transcription history to Markdown, plain text, or JSON in one command. Defaults: `~/Desktop/local-whisper-history.md`. Supports `--format`, `--out`, and `--limit`.
- **`wh stats`** prints local usage statistics: total sessions, total words and characters, average words per session, counts for today/7d/30d, first and last session timestamps, top words (stopwords filtered), and top replacement rules triggered.
- **`wh doctor --report [PATH]`** writes a shareable diagnostic report (macOS version, architecture, Python version, install method, service state, configured engine and backend, installed package versions, last 60 log lines). Safe to paste into a GitHub issue; never includes config contents, recorded audio, or transcription text.
- **`wh replace import <file>`** bulk-imports vocabulary rules from CSV, TSV, TOML-style (`"spoken" = "replacement"`), or arrow-style (`spoken -> replacement`) files. Duplicate keys in the input are surfaced in the summary.

### Fixed

- Toggling "Enable grammar correction" in Settings now loads or unloads the backend in-process instead of only writing the flag to config and leaving the model dangling.
- `⌥T` text-to-speech no longer clobbers the clipboard when it falls back to Cmd+C for text selection. The prior clipboard contents are saved and restored.
- Dead icon constants (`ICON_*`, `OVERLAY_WAVE_FRAMES`, `ANIM_INTERVAL_*`) and the dead `hide_dock_icon()` helper in `utils.py` removed. Asset imports no longer hard-crash the entire CLI if a single bundled PNG is missing.
- WhisperKit engine no longer accumulates `atexit` handlers across engine switches, and now fails fast if the server subprocess dies during startup instead of polling a dead PID for five minutes.
- Kokoro TTS model load is serialized through a dedicated lock so two callers cannot both pay the download cost in parallel on first use.
- Transcription engine and grammar backend validation in the config loader now derives valid values from the live registries. Registering a new engine or backend works with a single registry edit.
- `wh listen` now re-arms the pre-recording monitor stream when it finishes, so a subsequent hotkey capture still gets the configured pre-buffer.
- `wh update` aborts cleanly when `git pull` or `pip install` fails and prints the exact rollback command (`git reset --hard <sha>`) so the service never restarts against half-applied changes.
- `wh config show` piped into another command now exits non-zero when the config file is missing instead of silently succeeding.
- `wh uninstall` waits up to two seconds for graceful SIGTERM shutdown before escalating to SIGKILL, and surfaces the source-install venv path so you know exactly what remains to clean up.
- `wh doctor --fix` reports a real failure if `launchctl load` returns non-zero instead of printing "loaded" regardless.
- Ollama model list fetch in Advanced settings now uses a 5-second timeout so a stopped Ollama server no longer hangs the button indefinitely.
- About tab no longer force-unwraps credit URLs; a malformed string silently no-ops instead of crashing.
- `DeferredTextField`, `DeferredIntTextField`, and `DeferredTextEditor` now pick up external `config_snapshot` updates when the field is unfocused, so settings no longer appear stale after a backend or engine switch.
- `DeferredIntTextField` resets to the last committed value when you leave a non-parseable value in the field (previously it stayed diverged from the service indefinitely).
- `audio_processor._istft` uses an explicit `raise` instead of `assert` so its STFT overlap invariant holds under `python -O`.

### Changed

- Command socket protocol requests now use the `action` key (`{"action": "listen", ...}`) to match response framing and documentation. Both the CLI client and the service were updated in lockstep, so a normal `wh update` (which pulls code, upgrades deps, and restarts the service) moves both sides at once. Direct socket clients that used the previous `type` key must be updated.
- Apple Intelligence backend is now installed on macOS 15 and later (was gated on macOS 26+). The `.glassEffect` Swift UI still requires macOS 26.
- `./setup.sh` skips the Qwen3-ASR warm-up and the spaCy `en_core_web_sm` download when a sentinel or the already-installed module is detected, so re-running setup no longer repeats a two-minute warm-up or re-downloads models that are already present.
- Swift compiler warnings are surfaced to stderr on successful builds (previously they were deleted with the build log).

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Auto-paste at cursor: when enabled in General settings (`auto_paste`), transcribed text is pasted directly at the active cursor position after transcription. Your clipboard is untouched. Disabled by default.
- Text to Speech: select text in any app and press ⌥T to hear it read aloud. Kokoro-82M synthesizes speech on-device after the model is downloaded.
- Multiple voice presets with prefix-encoded language and gender. Default voice: `af_sky`. Selectable from General settings.
- Overlay shows "Generating speech..." while the model synthesizes, then "Speaking..." once audio starts playing.
- Press ⌥T again, Esc, or start a recording to stop speech at any point, including during model generation.
- Kokoro TTS model downloaded automatically during `setup.sh` and stored in `~/.whisper/models/`. Removed cleanly by `wh uninstall`.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- Apple Intelligence backend runs on-device via Apple's official Foundation Models Python SDK (`apple-fm-sdk`).

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Native SwiftUI interface targeting macOS 26 with Liquid Glass design throughout.
- Menu bar app with a full dropdown menu for grammar and engine selection, transcription history, and recordings.
- Floating overlay pill with glass effect showing recording duration, live audio levels, and processing status.
- Settings window with native macOS grouped forms across three tabs (General, Advanced, About).
- Real-time status updates in the menu bar and overlay during recording, processing, and transcription.
- Keyboard shortcuts in the menu bar: Cmd+R to retry, Cmd+Shift+C to copy last result, Cmd+, for settings, Cmd+Q to quit.
- Qwen3-ASR bf16 model (full precision) as the default transcription model.
- Language auto-detection for Qwen3-ASR.
- Model warm-up during setup so the first transcription starts without delay.
- Ollama model list fetched live in settings (pulls installed models automatically).
- Engine switching with automatic rollback: if the new engine fails to start, the previous engine stays active.
- Clear error message when WhisperKit CLI is not installed.

### Changed

- Default Qwen3-ASR model is the 1.7B-bf16 variant.
- WhisperKit is an optional engine. Install manually with `brew install whisperkit-cli` if needed.
- Text fields in settings save on Enter or focus loss instead of on every keystroke.
- Repetition penalty (1.2) added to Qwen3-ASR to reduce hallucination on short or silent recordings.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Qwen3-ASR is now the default transcription engine, running fully in-process with no server. It handles recordings up to 20 minutes natively.
- WhisperKit remains available as an alternative engine. Switch between engines via `wh engine <name>`, the Settings window, or by editing the config.
- Audio pre-processing pipeline applied before every transcription: voice activity detection, silence trimming, spectral noise reduction, and level normalization.
- Pre-recording buffer captures a short window of audio before the hotkey fires, so the first syllable is never clipped. Configurable via `pre_buffer` in config.
- Real-time audio level indicator in the recording overlay, color-coded by loudness.
- Engine selection and audio processing options exposed in the Settings window.
- History menu replaced with two dedicated submenus: Transcriptions shows the last 100 transcribed texts (newest first, click to copy), Recordings shows audio recordings (click to reveal in Finder). Both submenus rebuild lazily and include an "Open Folder" item.
- "Open Config File" button in Settings Advanced tab for quick access to config.toml.

### Changed

- Qwen3-ASR is the default transcription engine. New installs use it out of the box; the engine is configurable via config or Settings.
- Long recordings (over 28 seconds) are only split into segments when using WhisperKit. Qwen3-ASR handles them as a single pass.
- Completion notifications are now off by default.
- Settings window reorganized from 6 tabs to 3 (General, Advanced, About). Everyday options in General, advanced tuning in Advanced.
- Menu bar cleaned up: "Audio Files" renamed to "Recordings", "Backups" and "Config" items removed (redundant with in-app alternatives).
- Settings window now reliably opens over fullscreen apps.
